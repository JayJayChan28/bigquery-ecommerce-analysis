# 🛒 E-commerce Data Analysis with BigQuery

## 📌 Overview
I conducted an end-to-end data analysis project using **Google BigQuery**, a fully managed serverless data warehouse.  
The project focused on an **e-commerce dataset** containing millions of user session records from an online merchandise store.  
Using SQL, I explored the data, identified duplicates, and built queries to extract meaningful business insights about products, users, and traffic sources.
