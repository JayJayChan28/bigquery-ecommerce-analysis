# üõí E-commerce Data Analysis with BigQuery

## üìå Overview
I conducted an end-to-end data analysis project using **Google BigQuery**, a fully managed serverless data warehouse.  
The project focused on an **e-commerce dataset** containing millions of user session records from an online merchandise store.  
Using SQL, I explored the data, identified duplicates, and built queries to extract meaningful business insights about products, users, and traffic sources.

## üéØ Objectives
- Access and explore a large-scale e-commerce dataset in BigQuery  
- Review dataset schema and metadata  
- Identify and handle duplicate rows  
- Write SQL queries to analyze traffic, visitors, and product performance  
- Derive actionable insights and recommendations  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
- Tools: **Google Cloud Platform ‚Üí BigQuery**
- Languages: **SQL**
- Dataset size: ~21M+ rows (~5.6 GB)  

---

## üîé Data Exploration
- Used the **Schema tab** to inspect fields and data types  
- Reviewed **table metadata** to confirm record counts and storage size  
- Previewed rows to understand data distribution  
- Confirmed and removed duplicates using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` logic

## üßæ Queries & Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Unique Visitors and Views
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS unique_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`;
```
#### Insight: High repeat engagement ‚Äî total views far exceed unique visitors.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unique Visitors by Channel
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS unique_visitors,
  channelGrouping
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
GROUP BY channelGrouping
ORDER BY channelGrouping DESC;
```
#### Insight: Organic search and referrals outperform direct traffic in attracting new visitors.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Distinct Product Names
```sql
SELECT
  v2ProductName AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY ProductName;
```
#### Insight: The catalog contained 633 unique products, primarily apparel, accessories, and branded items.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Most-Viewed Products
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  v2ProductName AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY v2ProductName
ORDER BY product_views DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
#### Insight: T-shirts dominate visibility, but this doesn‚Äôt always translate to higher conversions.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Products by Unique Views per Visitor
```sql
WITH unique_product_views_by_person AS (
  SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    v2ProductName AS ProductName
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
  WHERE type = 'PAGE'
  GROUP BY fullVisitorId, v2ProductName
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS unique_view_count,
  ProductName
FROM unique_product_views_by_person
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY unique_view_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Insight: Certain niche items gain stronger traction per visitor than raw page views suggest.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Views, Orders, Quantities, and Avg Units per Order
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS product_views,
  COUNT(productQuantity) AS orders,
  SUM(productQuantity) AS quantity_product_ordered,
  SUM(productQuantity) / COUNT(productQuantity) AS avg_per_order,
  v2ProductName AS ProductName
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions`
WHERE type = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY v2ProductName
ORDER BY product_views DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Insight:
#### - The 22 oz YouTube Bottle Infuser had the highest average order size (~9.4 units/order).
#### - Apparel drove visibility but not bulk revenue.
